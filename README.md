# Version 1

## Overview
In this version, I developed the logic for my project and the initial architecture of the pipeline.

## Challenges

There are some inconsistencies regarding ingredient names that I was unable to resolve. I tried using some Python libraries to address the issue. For example, I transformed 'tomato' and 'tomatoes' to 'tomatoes,' but there are exceptions like 'ice' becoming 'rice.'

**If you have any suggestions to improve my project, please feel free to share them with me.**
