# Version 2

## Overview 

In this version, I made some enhancements to the code and added a logging mechanism.

## Challenges

There are some inconsistencies regarding ingredient names that I was unable to resolve. I tried using some Python libraries to address the issue. For example, I transformed 'tomato' and 'tomatoes' to 'tomatoes,' but there are exceptions like 'ice' becoming 'rice.' If you have any suggestions, please feel free to share them with me to improve my project.
